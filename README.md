# File-Manager
This is a very simple program that automatically organizes files in your desired folder by their file extensions. It scans the folder, creates subfolders for each file type (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`), and moves each file into its respective extension folder.
## ðŸ’¡Usage
1. In the source code file (*main.cpp*) at `line 8`, change the path to the desired folder you wish to organize
2. Then at `line 14` *if* conditions can be added more if you wish to exclude the file for automatically organizing. (*There's already an example for excluding desktop.ini in the *if* statement*)
3. Finally, run the exe for organizing!
4. If the exe is not working, you can compile main.cpp manually to get the executable file.
